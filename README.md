## SPECR


SPECR is an open source application for finding and viewing string patterns for both tennis and racquetball.
It's purpose is to make it easy to find the pattern for a particular racquet and to act as a reference during stringing.


## Motivation

When I first started stringing, I noticed that patterns aren't readily available. When I discovered a repository of patterns I found that the UI was no responsive and annoying to use while stringing.

The purpose of the this project is to be able to easily pull up stringing patterns. I hope this will also act as an archive of stringing pattterns.
